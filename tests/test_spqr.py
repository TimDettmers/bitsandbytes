# Tests for SpQR
## How Do We Know If We've Succeeded?
- You can successfully save a `Linear3BitSpQR` layer to disk, including the custom `Int3Params` data type and any additional state like scales, zero-points, and outliers.
- You can load this saved state back into a new `Linear3BitSpQR` layer, and all the internal state is restored correctly.
- After reloading, the model performs identically to how it did before being saved.

## Verification Themes
- **Functionality**: Verify the custom data type can hold and manipulate 3-bit quantized weights.
- **Performance**: Ensure minimal degradation in model performance.
- **State Consistency**: Validate that all state variables are saved and loaded correctly.
- **Computational Accuracy**: Verify that quantization and dequantization are performed as expected.

## Evaluation Criteria for Functionality:

1. **Initialization**: Test if `Params3bit` and `Linear3BitSpQR` can be initialized properly with the given data.
2. **Quantization and Packing**: Validate if weights are being correctly quantized into 3-bit integers and packed into 64-bit integers.
3. **State Management**: Verify if additional state variables (scales, zero-points, etc.) are initialized and managed properly.
4. **Serialization**: Ensure that custom state information is saved and loaded correctly.

Lines from original SpQR code related to testing and validation. These could be highly instructive for constructing our own test harness.

### From `quant_groups.py`

#### Line 108: Scale Assertion
```python
assert self.qq_scale.scale.shape == (scale_groups.shape[0], 1), self.qq_scale.scale.shape
```
**What it does:**  
This line checks the shape of the scale tensor, making sure it aligns with what is expected (`scale_groups.shape[0], 1`).

**Why it's relevant for testing:**  
This kind of assertion ensures that the scaling factors are of the correct dimension, which is crucial when you're dealing with custom quantization processes.

#### Line 119: Zero-Point Assertion
```python
assert self.qq_zero.scale.shape == (zero_groups.shape[0], 1), self.qq_zero.scale.shape
```
**What it does:**  
Similar to the previous line, this assertion checks the shape of the zero-point tensor.

**Why it's relevant for testing:**  
Ensuring that the zero-points are correctly structured is equally important for the quantization and dequantization processes.

### From `spqr_engine.py`

#### Line 22: Data Batch Assertion
```python
assert self.H is not None, "Already ran quantization; cannot add more data batches"
```
**What it does:**  
This line checks that the matrix \( H \) is not `None`, implying that you can't add more data batches after quantization has been run.

**Why it's relevant for testing:**  
This assertion can be used to ensure that the sequence of operations (like adding data and then quantizing) is done in the correct order.

#### Line 117: Hessian Shape Assertion
```python
assert H_inv_cho.shape[0] == H_inv_cho.shape[1] == weight.shape[1], "weight must be [out_features, in_features]"
```
**What it does:**  
Checks that the shape of the inverse Hessian (Cholesky decomposition) aligns with the weight shape.

**Why it's relevant for testing:**  
This is crucial for ensuring that the mathematical properties required for quantization hold, and could be adapted for your 3-bit implementation.

#### Line 150: Per-Channel Assertion
```python
assert perchannel, "refitting quantizer is only implemented for perchannel=True"
```
**What it does:**  
This assertion ensures that refitting the quantizer is only done for per-channel quantization.

**Why it's relevant for testing:**  
This could be relevant if you intend to implement or support per-channel quantization with your 3-bit scheme.

#### Line 299 and 313: Dimensionality Checks
```python
assert group_weight.ndim == 2
assert group_diag_hessian_inv_cho.ndim == 1
```
**What it does:**  
Checks the dimensionality of certain tensors involved in the quantization process.

**Why it's relevant for testing:**  
Ensuring that tensors have the correct dimensions is fundamental to the correct execution of any numerical algorithm. These checks could be adapted for your test suite.
