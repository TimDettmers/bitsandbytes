# Setup pre-commit hooks
- Install pre-commit hooks with `pip install pre-commit`.
- Run `pre-commit autoupdate` once to configure the hooks.
- Re-run `pre-commit autoupdate` every time a new hook got added.

Now all the pre-commit hooks will be automatically run when you try to commit and if they introduce some changes, you need to re-add the changed files before being able to commit and push.
