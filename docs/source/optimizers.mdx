Here we provide a short description and usage examples for each optimizer in `bitsandbytes.optim. We'll start by explaining the core optimizer class `Optimizer8bit`, followed by the specific implementations `Adagrad`, `Adagrad8bit` and `Adagrad32bit`.

Each of these optimizers can be utilized depending on the specific requirements of the task at hand, such as memory constraints, computational efficiency and the need for precision.

# Optimizer base class

## `Optimizer8bit`

The `Optimizer8bit` class serves as a base class for all 8-bit optimizers, providing common functionalities required for quantized optimization. The class is designed to support both 32-bit and 8-bit computations, where 8-bit optimizations can significantly reduce memory footprint and increase computation speed.

### Usage:

```python
import torch
from bitsandbytes.optim import Optimizer8bit

model = YourModel()
params = model.parameters()

# Initialize the optimizer with your model's parameters
optimizer = Optimizer8bit(params, defaults={
    'lr': 0.001,
    'betas': (0.9, 0.999),
    'eps': 1e-08,
    'weight_decay': 0
}, optim_bits=8)  # Use optim_bits=32 for 32-bit optimization

# In your training loop
optimizer.zero_grad()
loss = compute_loss()  # Implement your loss computation
loss.backward()
optimizer.step()
```

# Adagrad implementations

## `Adagrad`

The `Adagrad` class is an implementation of the Adagrad optimizer, which adapts the learning rate for each parameter based on the historical gradient information. This version allows for both 32-bit and 8-bit representations, with specific classes for each.

### `Adagrad` Usage:

```python
import torch
from bitsandbytes.optim import Adagrad

model = YourModel()
params = model.parameters()

# Initialize the optimizer with your model's parameters
optimizer = Adagrad(params, lr=0.01)

# In your training loop
optimizer.zero_grad()
loss = compute_loss()  # Implement your loss computation
loss.backward()
optimizer.step()
```

## `Adagrad8bit`

The `Adagrad8bit` class is specifically tailored for 8-bit optimization, inheriting from `Optimizer1State`. It is designed for models where memory efficiency is crucial and it operates with reduced precision to save memory and increase computation speed.

### `Adagrad8bit` Usage:

```python
import torch
from bitsandbytes.optim import Adagrad8bit

model = YourModel()

# Initialize the optimizer with your model's parameters
optimizer = Adagrad8bit(params, lr=0.01)

# In your training loop
optimizer.zero_grad()
loss = compute_loss()  # Implement your loss computation
loss.backward()
optimizer.step()
```

## Adagrad32bit

The `Adagrad32bit` class is similar to `Adagrad` but ensures that all computations are carried out with 32-bit precision. This class is preferable when numerical precision is more critical than memory efficiency.

### Adagrad32bit Usage:

```python
import torch
from bitsandbytes.optim import Adagrad32bit

model = YourModel()
params = model.parameters()

# Initialize the optimizer with your model's parameters
optimizer = Adagrad32bit(params, lr=0.01)

# In your training loop
optimizer.zero_grad()
loss = compute_loss()  # Implement your loss computation
loss.backward()
optimizer.step()
```
