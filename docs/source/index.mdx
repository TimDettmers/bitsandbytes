# bitsandbytes

bitsandbytes makes large language model inference and training more accessible by dramatically reducing memory consumption with 8-bit optimizers and k-bit quantization.

* 8-bit optimizers uses block-wise quantization to maintain 32-bit performance at a small fraction of the memory cost.
* LLM.Int() or 8-bit quantization enables large language model inference with only half the required memory and without any performance degradation. This method is based on vector-wise quantization to quantize most features to 8-bits and separately treating outliers with 16-bit matrix multiplication.
* QLoRA or 4-bit quantization enables large language model training with several memory-saving techniques that don't compromise performance. This method quantizes a model to 4-bits and inserts a small set of trainable low-rank adaptation (LoRA) weights to allow training.
