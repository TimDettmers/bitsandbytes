# AdaGrad

[AdaGrad (Adaptive Gradient)](https://jmlr.org/papers/v12/duchi11a.html) is an optimizer that adaptively adjusts the learning rate for each parameter based on their historical gradients.

* Parameters with larger gradients are updated with smaller learning rates to avoid overshooting the minimum. 
* Parameters with smaller gradients are updated with larger learning rates to catch up and converge faster.

Since learning rates are automatically adjusted, AdaGrad does not require manually tuning learning rates.
