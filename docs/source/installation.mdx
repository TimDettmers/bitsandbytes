# Installation

Note currently `bitsandbytes` is only supported on CUDA GPU hardwares, support for AMD GPUs and M1 chips (MacOS) is coming soon.

## Linux

### From Pypi

```bash
pip install bitsandbytes
```

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes.git && cd bitsandbytes/
CUDA_VERSION=XXX make cuda12x
python setup.py install
```

with `XXX` being your CUDA version, for <12.0 call `make cuda 11x`. Note support for non-CUDA GPUs (e.g. AMD, Intel), is also coming soon.

## Windows

Currently for Windows users, you need to build bitsandbytes from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes.git && cd bitsandbytes/
cmake -B build -DBUILD_CUDA=ON -S .
cmake --build build --config Release
python -m build --wheel
```
