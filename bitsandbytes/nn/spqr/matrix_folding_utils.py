# The Workflow

1. **Divide the Weight Matrix**: Slice your weight matrix into \( \beta_1 \times \beta_2 \) blocks.
2. **Quantize Each Block**: Use the quantization logic to convert each block into 3-bit quantized weights, 1st and 2nd order scales, and zero-points.
3. **Identify and Store Outliers**: Use the SpQR logic to identify outliers and store them in 32-bit buffers.

# How Do We Know If It's Working:

1. **Test the Division**: Verify that the weight matrix is correctly divided into \( \beta_1 \times \beta_2 \) blocks.
2. **Quantization Tests**: Confirm that the quantized weights and the scales and zero-points are correctly computed.
3. **Outlier Tests**: Make sure the outliers are correctly identified and stored.
4. **End-to-End Tests**: After running the entire pipeline, compare the performance of the original and quantized models to ensure there's minimal degradation.
