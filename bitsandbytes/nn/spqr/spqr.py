# Problem Statement

Implement a specialized 3-bit weight quantization for neural networks, based on the SpQR (Sparse Quantized Representation) method. The goal is to achieve significant model compression with minimal performance degradation. Special focus is on creating a custom data type to hold 3-bit weights and additional state information (scales, zero-points, and outliers).

# Implementation
- Used `torch.nn.Parameter` and `nn.Module` for custom data types and layers.
- Integrated with PyTorch through custom parameter types, layer inheritance, and serialization hooks.
- Created a separate Python module with functionalities and another for the test suite.
- Employed `pytest` for testing.

# Snippets from Original SpQR Codebase

These snippets offer key insights into the quantization and dequantization processes, how they're integrated into a larger system (`spqr_engine.py`), and how you might adapt these for 3-bit SpQR. Specifically, understanding these functions will help you develop your custom data type for 3-bit weights (`Params3bit`), manage state in a custom layer (`Linear3BitSpQR`), and serialize this information for saving and loading models.

### 1. From `quant_groups.py`

#### Line 5: Quantize and Dequantize Function
```python
def quantize_dequantize(x, scale, zero, maxq, eps=1e-9):
```
**What it does:**  
This function is likely responsible for both quantizing and dequantizing the input tensor `x`. It takes in a scale and zero-point (`scale` and `zero`), as well as a maximum quantization value (`maxq`).

**Why it's relevant:**  
This function shows the basic formula for quantization and dequantization, something you'll need to adapt for 3-bit representation.

#### Line 10: Quantize Function
```python
def quantize(x, scale, zero, maxq, eps=1e-9):
```
**What it does:**  
This function appears to handle only the quantization part, using the scale, zero-point, and maximum quantization value.

**Why it's relevant:**  
Again, this function provides a good starting point for understanding how to go about the actual quantization.

### 2. From `spqr_engine.py`

#### Line 8: Importing Quantization Functions
```python
from quant_groups import Quantizer, quantize, dequantize
```
**What it does:**  
Imports quantization and dequantization functionalities from `quant_groups`.

**Why it's relevant:**  
This line indicates that `spqr_engine.py` uses the quantization methods defined in `quant_groups.py`, so you should understand them both.

#### Line 36: Main Quantization Function
```python
def quantize(
```
**What it does:**  
This function seems to be a more comprehensive quantization function and likely includes more functionalities, possibly like outlier detection and handling.

**Why it's relevant:**  
This is the function where most of the magic happens. It probably integrates everything, from weight quantization to outlier management, making it essential for you to understand.

#### Line 61: Handling Features
```python
:param keep_last_columns: if not None, keep the last (this many) input features un_quantized and return them
```
**What it does:**  
This line suggests that the function allows certain features to remain unquantized, likely for handling sensitive weights or important features.

**Why it's relevant:**  
It gives you an idea that not all weights might have to be quantized, which aligns with the SpQR philosophy of paying special attention to sensitive or important weights.

### Why Are the Outliers in 32-bit?

In the case of SpQR, outliers are weights that are deemed too "sensitive" or important to be quantized down to 3-bits. These weights are stored in their original, higher-precision form to preserve their impact on the model's performance. According to the paper, each outlier is stored as two 16-bit values: one for the weight value and another for the column index, making it a total of 32 bits for each outlier.

#### For Dummies: 
Imagine you're sorting through a box of various fruits to save space. You decide to chop most of them into smaller pieces except for some special fruits like a truffle-infused apple that you want to keep whole. These special fruits are the "outliers," and because they're special, you keep them in their original form, which naturally takes up more space than the chopped fruits.

#### For the Skilled Implementer:
In the context of neural networks, using a 32-bit representation for outliers makes sense for several reasons:

1. **Preservation of Information**: The 16-bit weight value allows for a high level of granularity, thus maintaining the weight's original value without much loss of information.

2. **Indexing**: The 16-bit column index is crucial for unstructured sparsity. It allows the model to know where to place these outlier weights during the forward and backward passes, ensuring that they contribute to the computation correctly.

3. **Efficient Access**: Storing the index alongside the weight makes accessing these values more cache-efficient, which can be crucial for computational performance.

4. **Compatibility**: 32-bit (or rather, 16-bit for each part of the outlier) is a commonly used size for floating-point numbers and integers in computing, making it a convenient choice from a hardware perspective.

### How Do We Know If It's Working:

When you implement the 32-bit storage for outliers, you should be able to:

1. Accurately identify which weights are outliers based on your chosen criteria.
2. Store these weights in 32-bit form (16 bits for the weight value and 16 bits for the index).
3. Successfully save and reload this information using PyTorch's serialization methods (`_save_to_state_dict` and `_load_from_state_dict`).
4. Verify that the "restored" outliers are identical to the original ones and that they are placed correctly in the weight matrix.

To sum it up, the outliers are in 32-bit to preserve their original value and to maintain their positional information, which is crucial for the accurate and efficient functioning of the model.
